# Powered-Air-Purifying-Respirators-PAPR-
A Build It Yourself Powered Air Purifying Respirator made from readily available and relatively low cost parts.

### Purpose
From the onset of the Covid19 Pandemic, I wanted to focus specifically on PPE for  both medical staff and Caregivers. As the weeks went on and Sheltering in place orders where issued, it made the most sense. Providing PPE for medical staff and other first responders is a resources intensive endeavor, and it is very regulated. However caegivers seemed to be overlooked. Caregivers are family members who are on the front lines at home taking care of other family members who may be immune compromised and or elderly. So this is for them, and anyone else who may be in need of a higher end  low cost PPE. This isnt just A PAPR system, it is akso a full body protective system.

### Inspiration: 
I was inspired by this [project](https://github.com/jcl5m1/ventilator/wiki/Build-a-Low-Cost-PAPR)  by [Johnny Lee](https://github.com/jcl5m1) though I decided to go in a different design direction. His prokect project provided me with a wealth of knowledge.
